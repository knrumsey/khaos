\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame or matrix of input predictors, scaled to be between 0 and 1.}

\item{y}{A numeric response vector of length \code{nrow(X)}.}

\item{degree}{A vector of length 3 specifying the degree schedule: \code{c(d_init, d_increment, d_max)}. The degree is increased by \code{d_increment} if the current model includes a term of maximal degree, up to \code{d_max}.}

\item{order}{A vector of length 3 specifying the interaction order schedule: \code{c(q_init, q_increment, q_max)}.}

\item{sigma_prior}{A vector \code{c(v0, s0)} specifying the inverse-gamma prior on \eqn{sigma^2}: degrees of freedom (\code{v0}) and scale (\code{s0}). The prior is \eqn{sigma^2 \sim \text{Inv-Gamma}(v_0/2, v_0 s_0^2 / 2)}.}

\item{g_prior}{A vector \code{c(n0, m0, xi)} where \code{n0} is the prior strength on \eqn{g_0^2}, \code{m0} is the prior mean, and \code{xi} controls the penalty on complex basis functions in the modified \(g\)-prior. The prior is \eqn{g_0^2 \sim \text{Inv-Gamma}(n_0/2, n_0 m_0 / 2)}.}

\item{sM}{A numeric value controlling the model complexity prior: \eqn{p(\mathcal{M}) \propto |M|^{-s_M}}. Set \code{sM = 0} for a uniform prior over model size (default).}

\item{regularize}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, applies LASSO-based pre-screening to reduce the size of the candidate basis set.}

\item{enrichment}{An integer between 0 and 3 specifying the enrichment strategy to use. See Details.}

\item{evidence}{Character string specifying how marginal likelihood evaluation should be handled. One of \code{"auto"}, \code{"fast"}, or \code{"full"}. See Details.}

\item{control}{named \code{list()} of secondary tuning parameters, see

\description{
A Bayesian implementation of sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), based on the framework of Shao et al. (2017), with modifications to improve flexibility, numerical stability, and support for Bayesian model evidence evaluation.
}
\details{
The function builds the model incrementally, starting with polynomial degree \code{degree[1]} and interaction order \code{order[1]}. If the current model includes any terms of maximal degree or order, the values are increased (up to \code{degree[3]} and \code{order[3]}, respectively), and the process restarts.

The modified \(g\)-prior used here includes an additional shrinkage term controlled by \code{xi}, which penalizes complex basis functions based on their total degree and interaction order. Priors over \(sigma^2\) and \(g_0^2\) are specified using interpretable parameters derived from standard inverse-gamma formulations.

The \code{evidence} argument controls how marginal likelihoods are evaluated during model selection. If \code{"auto"}, the algorithm performs a one-time diagnostic of the input distribution using Kolmogorov–Smirnov and simulation-based Frobenius norm tests to determine whether the orthogonality approximation can be safely used. The options \code{"fast"} and \code{"full"} override this and force either the approximation or the full method, respectively.

Five enrichment strategies are implemented (from fastest to slowest):
\describe{
\item{0}{Local enrichment only, using all four enrichment operators.}
\item{1}{Original Shao method (discard inactives, full rebuild).}
\item{2}{Build all active-variable terms and enrich only around previously accepted basis functions.}
\item{3}{Build all active-variable terms and enrich with inactives.}
\item{4}{Full rebuild}
}
Note that the sull rebuild is always used unless the full number of candidates exceeds \verb{code\{max_basis_enrichment\}}.
